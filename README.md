# vim

This is my customized vim configuration.  

It contains some useful plugins, like NERDTree, and some handy settings, like automatically setting a tab to four spaces.

<h1>Dependencies</h1>

The following packages must be installed first:

<ul>
  <li>vim-plug -- Just clone https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug to your home directory.
</ul>

To use it follow these steps:

<ul>
  <li>Clone the repository to your home directory.
  <li>Open vim.
  <li>Type ':PlugInstall'
</ul>

All done!
