# vim

This is my customized vim configuration.  It contains some useful plugins, like NERDTree, and some handy settings, like automatically setting a tab to four spaces.

To use it follow these steps:

<br>Clone the repository to your home directory.
<br>Open vim.
<br>Type ':PlugInstall'

All done!
